# Welcome to My Blog

This is an example blog post. You can delete this file and create your own blog posts.

## How to Create a Blog Post

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `src/lib/content/blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with `title`, `date`, and `description`
3. Write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter

That's it! Your post will automatically appear on the blog page.
